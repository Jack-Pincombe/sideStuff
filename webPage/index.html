    <p>
      Hello my name is Jack Pincombe a Computer Science student
      with the Open University. You are probably looking at this
      web page as a result of an job application that you have
      received from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a second year student with the Open University and due to the
      nature of this course, the idea of relocation is not an issue as I
      will be able to move anywhere in the world and I will still be able to complete
      my assisnments attend online tutorials all while working for your company
      during the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      But hopefully you are here to read about me and not the nature of the Open University
      operations. :)
    </p>

    <h3>What Can I do?</h3>

    <p>
      As a student I do not at this current time have any commercial experiance as a developer,
      which is why I am so keen to begin so that I will be able to build my career and get
      the ball rolling to become a senior developer and to be able to contribute to some
      serious projects.
